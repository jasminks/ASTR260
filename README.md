#ASTR260 (computational physics and astronomy)
In this class I had a computer designated to working in class and on homework. 
All my work for this class was done on this computer.
When the class finished, I took all of my directories off of the computer. 
I also got all the resources from Laulima, and the codes I uploaded (HW and exams)

I never bothered one bit to really organize this code, which is a seriously great resource.

##Goals:
1. Make directories for all chapters/modules with:
      * resource code 
      * example codes
      * codes I created


2. Make a homework directory! Again, wih all proper dependencies.
3. Make an exam directory.
4. Organize remaining resources and such.
