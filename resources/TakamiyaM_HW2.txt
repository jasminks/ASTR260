Problem 1
Exercise 5.2
a) Python program in Dropbox named: TakamiyaM_HW2_p1.py 
b) Fractional error is 0.0001 or 0.01%
c) Python program in part (a) contains slices of 10, 100, and 1000.
   The Simpson rule converges to the analytical result with 1000 slices but the Trapezoid rule does not converge.

Problem 2
Exercies 5.3
a) Using both the Simpson and Trapezoid rules with 30 slices, I obtain the following values:
using the  Simpson  rule is 0.886207336227
using the Trapezoid rule is 0.88620673428 
I would generally use the Simpson rule for highly variable functions but the Trapezoid rule when the function varies slowly.
They are differ at the seventh significant digit.
